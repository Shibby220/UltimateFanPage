# Ultimate Music Fan Page Generator

This website allows the user to input their favorite/desired band/artist's name into the search bar, and dynamically generates data related to the band using the youtube, last.fm, and ticket master API's. 

Once the user types a band/artist name in the search bar, and clicking search, the cards are then populated with info about the band including: Top Tracks, Top Albums,Biography, links to social media, and tickets for live events. The background image in the Jumbotron is populated with a picture of the artist/band as well.

Each time a new search is done all the cards will be cleared and replaced with info for the new band and the jumbotron background image will change to reflect the new band that was searched.

Top tracks, albums, and biography info is being pulled and data dynamically generated on the page by using the last.fm API.

Band/artist image, social media, and concet ticket links are being pulled and data dynamically generated on the page using the ticketmaster API.
